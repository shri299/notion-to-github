# Notion to GitHub Sync

This project syncs Notion pages or databases to GitHub. The sync traverses nested pages so each page becomes its own Markdown file in a directory structure that mirrors the Notion hierarchy. Work is currently maintained on the `generic_sync` branch so the main branch stays clean for production-ready code.
